To execute a C++ program using the terminal:

cd filelocation
ls
g++ filename.cpp
./a.out

ex: (Clone the repo to try this:)
cd /Desktop/C++/TheFirst/CODE FILES
ls
g++ datatypes.cpp
./a.out

OUTPUT:
THIS STRING IS A CONSTANT
3.4

IF THERE ARE ANY COMMENTS IN THE VERY FIRST LINE OF THE MAIN FUNCTION WITH THE CAPSLOCK ON, THEN THEY ARE QUESTIONS THAT I NEED TO FIND ANSWERS FOR, THE ONES I COULDN'T AT THE BEGINNING OF MY LEARNING.
